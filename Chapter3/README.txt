Below you will find an explanation of the different files

RWM.py  -   Shows an example of a Random Walk Metropolis for a given target.
            Produces the figures "RWM.png" and "Trace_RWM.png"

HMC.py  -   Show the same example as in RWM.py, but with the Hamiltonian
            Monte Carlo instead. Produces the figures "HMC.png" and 
            "Trace_HMC.png"
