Below you will find an explanation of the different files

gluon_mult.py   -   Calculates the gluon multiplicity for the BDMPS spectrum,
                    and produces the figure named "gluon_mult.png"

BDMS_Eloss.py   -   Calculates the energy-loss distribution numerically using 
                    the full BDMPS spectrum for a quark and a gluon. The 
                    produces values are saved in the csv files named 
                    "BDMS_quark.csv" and "BDMS_gluon.csv"

BDMS_Fit.py     -   Plots the results from "BDMS_Eloss.py" together with the
                    analytical approximations. It produces the figure named
                    "BDMS_Fit.png"
